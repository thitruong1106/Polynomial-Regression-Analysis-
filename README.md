# Polynomial-Regression-Analysis-

The Python code uses polynomial Regression to model the relationship between weight (independant varaible) and Systolic (Dependent variable) from the dataset "bloodpressure.csv". 
Iterating through polynomial regression models of degrees 1 - 14, while calculating and printing the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the square root of the RMSE for each of the degree. 
Scatter plots are visualised for regression lines. Performs 10 folds cross validation in order to access model performance and select the best polynomial degree based on the lowest value
of the mean squared error. The data is also spilt into training and testing sets, fitting polynomial regression model for various different degreees. When the best degree is determined, the coefficients of the model will print. 
As well as visualising the training and validation error as a function of the polynomial degree.
